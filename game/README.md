# Monad - Game Notes

A work-in-progress overview of the Monad game.

## High Level Considerations

* Turn based
* Simple / constrained instruction set
* Aesthetically pleasing visualization
* Victory follows naturally from effective gameplay (no 'inflection points')
* Fundamental tradeoffs
	* Offense v.s. defense
	* Aggression v.s. conservatism
	* Make yourself better off v.s. make opponent worse off
* Unsolved / unsolvable (no dominant strategy, large game tree)
* Fast paced (relatively - no fun to watch computers play chess)
* Time constraints (scalability)
* Space for continuous improvement / optimization
	* Multiple objectives
	* Objectives can be optimized independently
	* Balance
* Heuristics
	* Simple to grasp / comprehend
	* Difficult to exploit
