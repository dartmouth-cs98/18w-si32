Si32 Web
========

The UI component of Si32. 

## Building and Running
From this directory, `docker-compose build` and then `docker-compose up` should
run the front end on your machine at `localhost:4000`.

Any changes to code inside `/src` should propagate through without needing
to rebuild the image.
